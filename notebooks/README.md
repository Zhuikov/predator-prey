# Notebooks description
1. [Life model](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/LifeModel.ipynb) contains detailed desciption of the single-agent model.
2. [Dynamic life model](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/DynamicLifeModel.ipynb) contains detailed parameter selection.
3. [Experiment 1](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/Experiment_1.ipynb) is the first experiment stage. We launch the model at each plan point and analyze received results.
4. [Experiment 2](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/Experiment_2.ipynb) is the second experiment stage. We launch the model at each refined plan point and analyze received results.
5. [Experiment 3](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/Experiment_3.ipynb) and [Experiment 4](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/Experiment_4.ipynb) are the third experiment stage. We launch the model again for best ratios which recieved from previous stages.
6. [Experiment 5](https://github.com/Zhuikov/predator-prey/blob/develop/notebooks/Experiment_5.ipynb) is last experiment stage. We explore probability model features.
